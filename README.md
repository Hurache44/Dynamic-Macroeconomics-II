# Dynamic-Macroeconomics-II
Dynamic Macroeconomics II - Model for solving the basic New Keynesian Model

Matlab Dynare code

The model is from the lecture Dynamic Macroeconomics and includes the basic calibration from Johannes Pfeifers approach.
I coded the model by myself and lectures are provided by Dr. Klara Major and Dr. Gregor von Schweinitz. All rights and
contributions belong to the authors.

The distributions of the parameters to be estimated are included in the calculation to specify their prior distributions.
