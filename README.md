Dynamic Macroeconomics II - Model for solving the basic New Keynesian Model

The model is from the lecture Dynamic Macroeconomics and includes the basic calibration from Johannes Pfeifers approach.
I coded the model by myself and lectures are provided by Dr. Klara Major and Dr. Gregor von Schweinitz. All rights and
